# Goal
The goal of this call is to coordinate workstreams among independent development teams working on public goods for the Livepeer network.

By creating this avenue, we can (1) speed up development, (2) eliminate redundancy, and (3) create the conditions necessary for further decentralization of Network development.

We will cover:
- Gateway development (including Analytics and observability)
- Orchestrator development (including Analytics and observability)
- SDK & Frontend Development
In the future, it is possible that we will plan breakout sessions for each track.

Protocol-level development is out of scope for this call unless strictly related to the work tracks above. In the short term, our primary focus will be the AI network; transcoding-related work remains in scope but AI-related work will be prioritized.

A good mental model is the tightly coordinated relationship between development teams on the Ethereum network; participants in this call do not dictate one another’s work, but are working towards a common goal which necessitates close coordination of technical direction and timelines.

# Note re: participation
This meeting is ultimately voluntary, and it needs to provide value to attendees. We might need to iterate on the structure together, and that structure might need to change as the ecosystem grows and evolves. 

For now, we’d like to ask for your participation in this effort to create a stronger technical foundation for the success of the Livepeer ecosystem. 

# Day / Time
Every other Thursday morning - 1h 30min at 4pm GMT / 11am EST 

# Structure
## Requested Representation
At least 1 technical team member from each core development team and/or SPE.

We ask that each team designate (1) a primary point of contact, who will be responsible for making sure progress updates and shareouts are completed, and (2) a secondary point of contact as a backup if the primary point of contact is unavailable.

Beyond the primary point of contact, teams should feel empowered to manage their participation.

## Availability
Public in Discord. Anyone can listen in and we may call up contributors, but in general the stage will be limited to core dev teams and SPE representatives only 

## Workstyle
In short, let’s focus on building and assume good intentions. Disagreements may arise; if they do, let’s be professional about it. 

## Pre-reads
At least 1 day prior to the call, participants will provide a high-level summary of
- Priorities
- Blockers
- Proposed discussion topics

Please note that you are not being asked to share any privileged information; the goal is to understand what development is happening and coordinate it to the extent possible.
